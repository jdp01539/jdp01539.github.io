            <H2 style="text-align: center">The History behind the Match-up</H2>
            <div class="mainBody">
                <p>The first meeting between the two schools occurred in 1897, over 120 years ago. Little did they know they were beginning one of the greatest rivalries in all of sports. These two teams have met a staggering 115 times, and there is no love lost between them. At the end of each season, these teams clash in epic fashion. Records do not matter when “the team up north” and “ohio” face off. Michigan ruled in the past, but this century has been all about the Buckeyes; Ohio State has won 16 of the last 19 meetings, including two separate 7-win streaks against the Wolverines.</p>
                
                <p>The latest matchup put playoff minded #4 Michigan against a reeling #10 Ohio State team who had just come off of an overtime thriller to an under 500 team in Maryland. The winner would clinch a Big Ten Championship berth. Michigan had the best defense in the country, but Ohio State had the second-best offense in the country. One has to break, and goodness did the floodgates open. The Buckeyes accounted for 62 points and 567 total yards against the stout Wolverine defense. Michigan was known for their pass defense, only allowing around 150 yards per game. Dwayne Haskins, the Buckeyes’ QB, had surpassed this in the first half with around 220 passing yards. By game’s end, Haskins threw for 396 yards and 6 touchdowns.</p>
                
                <p>Now the offense was not the only reason Ohio State won their 7th game in a row against Michigan. The Buckeyes’ underachieving defense finally figured themselves out, and they were able to slow down the Michigan offense and force two turnovers. </p>
                
                <p>Harbaugh and Meyer continue the tradition of Bo and Woody as the rivalry continue to rage on in its glory. Until next year, Go Bucks!</p>
